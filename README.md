# UCCSC Conference Management for Drupal

## Installation
This is a collection of four Drupal Features. It behaves like a module, and can be installed like a module. It has a long list of dependencies, so be sure you install all of those as well.

You don't have to enable all four Features at the same time. Depending on the timeline of your conference preparation, you may want to enable the UCCSC Sponsors Feature first, then, when you're ready to open Session Proposals, enable  UCCSC Event and UCCSC User. (Those two do have to be installed at the same time.) Lastly, when you're ready to open Registration, enable UCCSC Registration.

## Recommended Usage
Once installed, DON'T UPDATE THIS MODULE. Consider this an initial start-state, and afterwards manage the configuration of your site via the standard Drupal Configuration Management System.

## Contributing Back
After your conference is complete, create a Pull Request in [UCCSC GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ucdavis/uccsc) so we can all benefit in the fruits of your labor.
